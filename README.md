## OMS Test Solution
The solution is a Unity project with a very simple UI. There are a few buttons on the screen representing each test task. 
There is a GameObject called "Tasks" where you can change all the values that are taken for task solutions. 
Moreover, there is a GameObject called "Timeline" where you can check Timeline activation and animation tracks. 

All outputs of functions are displayed to Unity's console window. 

#### OMS Basic Unity Programming Test
1. Clicking the "Binary Tree PreOrder/InOrder/PostOrder Traversal" button will traverse a created binary tree in the specified order. 
2. Clicking the "FizzBuzz" button will start a function that will output FizzBuzz results.
3. Clicking the "String Match" button will start a function that will compare two strings. The result is a percentage of common chars in two strings. The result is calculated in the following way: the number of equal characters divided by the length of the longest string (either target or guess string) and multiplied by 100.

#### OMS Basic Unity Tasks / Timeline Test
1. There are three cubes in the scene (disabled by default). There was a separate animation created for each one of them. 
2. Clicking the "Play Timeline" button will disable the UI for some time and will trigger animations using a timeline.
